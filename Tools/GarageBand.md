# GarageBand

## Structure

- Song: the main file/document
- Track: a vertical row in a song
- Region: one clip on a track
- Loop: regions from the Loop Library

## Recording system audio

- via microphone
- Screenflick Loopback plugin
- Soundflower: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower

## Sample a loop

- Record sound from Spotify etc:
	- Start screen recording in iOS
	- Play song
	- Stop screen recording to save video
	- Upload video on https://audio-extractor.net/
	- Download sound clip (M4A format) to Files app
- Import sound clip into GarageBand
	- “Loops” icon (➰) in top-right corner, then the Files tab, then “Browse items from the Files app”
- Adjust BPM to match the clip’s tempo
	- Google the song title and input the value (typically 100-130 BPM) in Settings → Tempo
- Note: you can’t normally time-stretch (change tempo) the clip, but if you save to Loop Library and then re-add it to your track, you can!
