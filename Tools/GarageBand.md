## Sample a loop

_**Note:** read up on [the legal aspects of sampling](https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/music-rights/clear-samples-to-copyrighted-music/) before you release tracks with samples publicly._

**Sampling songs in GarageBand for iOS and macOS:**

- Record sound from Spotify etc:
	- Start screen recording in iOS
	- Play song
	- Stop screen recording to save video
	- Upload video on https://audio-extractor.net/
	- Download sound clip (M4A format) to Files app
- Import sound clip into GarageBand
	- “Loops” icon (➰) in top-right corner, then the Files tab, then “Browse items from the Files app”
- Adjust song’s tempo to match the imported sample clip
	- Why? You want this so the bars in the song lines up with the sample clip
	- Google `[song title] BPM` and input the result (typically 100-130 BPM) in Settings → Tempo
- **Note:** you can’t normally time-stretch (change tempo) the clip, but if you save to GarageBand Loop Library and then re-add it to your track, you can!
