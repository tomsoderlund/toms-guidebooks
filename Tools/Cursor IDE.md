# Cursor IDE

### 1. Modes & Shortcuts
- **Agent Mode**: `⌘ + I`
- **Edit Mode**: `⌘ + K`
- **Ask Mode**: `⌘ + L`
- Many prefer using **chat or composer** to point to code snippets or files in the prompt.

### 2. Using Agent Mode Effectively
- Highlight code before pressing `⌘ + I` to include it in context.
- After opening Agent Mode, `⌘ + N` is useful for starting a new chat.
- Use `/` when starting to type to include code files in context.
- Use `@` to add files or docs, and `@web` to force a web search.

### 3. Claude Model Differences
- **Claude 3.7**: Some find it more "talkative" and prone to taking liberties.
- **Claude 3.5 & GPT-4o**: More straightforward for direct tasks.

### 4. Additional Tips
- **Rules Folder**: Check Cursor’s documentation for useful settings.
- **Screenshots & Sketches**: Uploading these can speed up the process.
- **Frontend Help**: AI is "good enough" for tweaking but not outstanding.
- **Frequent Updates**: Cursor releases new versions almost daily, so keep it updated. A subtle update notification appears in the lower-left corner.
