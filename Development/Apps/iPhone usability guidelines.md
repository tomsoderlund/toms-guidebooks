# iPhone usability guidelines

Platform Differences:
  1. Compact Screen Size
  2. Memory is Not Unlimited
  3. One Window at a Time
  4. One Application at a Time
  5. Minimal User Help

Extra:
Use a minumum of text
Save where you were: save the current state when stopping, at the finest level of detail possible. For example, if your application displays scrolling data, save the current scroll position.


Game = "Immersive Application"


Human Interface Principles: Creating a Great User Interface:

Metaphors: e.g. playback controls, tapping controls to make things happen, sliding on-off switches.
Direct Manipulation: result of the userâ€™s action is immediately apparent.
See and Point: presenting choices or options in list form, so users can easily scan them and make a choice.
Feedback: users need immediate feedback when they operate controls and ongoing status reports during lengthy operations.
User Control: allow users, not your application, to initiate/control/stop actions.
Aesthetic Integrity: in an immersive application, users expect a beautiful appearance that promises fun and encourages discovery.

Incorporate Characteristics of Great iPhone Applications:
- Build in Simplicity and Ease of Use
- Focus on the Primary Task
- Communicate Effectively
