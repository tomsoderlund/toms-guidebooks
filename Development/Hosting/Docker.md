# Docker

- Developer machine -> [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or Docker Engine Community
- Small server -> Docker Engine Community
- Critical applications -> Docker Engine Enterprise or Kubernetes

## Concepts

- **Container**: a virtual machine
- **Server**: runs multiple Containers
- **Image**: a template used to create Container(s)
- **Registry**: storage for Images

## Commands

	docker run --help

- `docker ps`: lists the containers that are still running. Add the `-a` switch in order to see containers that have stopped
- `docker logs [container ID]`: retrieves the logs of a container, even when it has stopped
- `docker inspect [container ID]`: gets detailed information about a running or stopped container
- `docker stop`: stops a container that is still running
- `docker rm`: deletes a container

### docker run

		docker run hello-world

## Vagrant
