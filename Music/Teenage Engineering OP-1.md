## Synth engines

- **Cluster**: up to six oscillators chained in a cluster. Creating complex, rich pads or polyphonic textures with its multi-oscillator setup.
- **Digital**: pure digital raw engine. Crafting crisp, clear digital sounds for lead lines or arpeggiated patterns.
- **DNA**: cpu id noise synthesis. Generating unique, unpredictable sounds for experimental music or sound design elements.
- **Dr Wave**: raw 8-bit style engine. Producing lo-fi, chiptune, or 8-bit sounds perfect for retro game music or nostalgic tracks.
- **DSynth**: dual oscillator synthesizer. Designing powerful dual-oscillator sounds, ideal for dynamic leads or aggressive bass lines.
- **FM**: frequency modulation synthesis made easy. this is the type of engine that is found in the classic DX7 synthesizer. Creating classic FM synthesis sounds, from electric pianos to metallic percussion, reminiscent of the 80s.
- **Phase**: phase distortion type engine. Generating phased, distorted sounds for edgy leads or innovative soundscapes.
- **Pulse**: square wave engine. Making thick, square wave-based sounds, great for basses or PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) leads.
- **Sampler**: uses 6 second AIFF (`.aif`) files. The same sound is mapped to the piano keys and is repitched.
- **String**: physical modeling of a string instrument. Simulating string instruments for realistic plucked or bowed string sounds in tracks.
- **Voltage**: multi oscillator electric synthesis. Crafting complex, evolving sounds with its multiple oscillators, suitable for pads, leads, or experimental tones.

## Drum engines

- **DBox**: a dual oscillator synthesizer, convenient for producing drum sounds.
- **Drum**: sampler, 12 second AIFF (`.aif`) files. Slices of the sound file can be mapped to individual piano keys.
