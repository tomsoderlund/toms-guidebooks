* Add grid as helper
* Set anchor point + move layer same distance
* Camera far plane
* “Flatten” group (in properties)
* Scale until match edge
* “Four corner” until grid lines up
* Help: View -> Show Full View Area


### Behaviors

Audio: link to audio file
Average: smooth
Clamp: set min/max
Custom: 
Exponential: creates more natural animations when scaling objects
Link: link to other object
Logarithmic: the inverse of the Exponential behavior
MIDI: animate object parameters using standard MIDI devices
Negate: multiplying the parameter by –1
Oscillate: cycling it between two different values
Quantize: incremental animation in steps
Ramp: gradual transition in any parameter that can be animated, from the Start Value to the End Value
Randomize: randomly increasing and decreasing values
Rate: increases a parameter’s value over time, with the rate of increase determined by the Rate slider
Reverse: the Reverse behavior reverses the direction of any animation that affects a parameter, whether it’s caused by behaviors or keyframes
Stop: suspends parameter animation
Track: apply tracking data to a parameter of an effect, such as the center point of the Light Rays filter
Wriggle: similarly to the Randomize behavior, but with a slower effect
